Iâ€™m a Flutter developer with over 2 years of experience building cross-platform mobile apps using Dart, Firebase, and REST APIs. I specialize in crafting responsive UIs, optimizing performance, and deploying polished apps to both Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

At Armino Technologies, I worked on real-world products like diet subscription platforms and POS systems, where I improved app performance by 40%, integrated GraphQL/REST APIs, and implemented scalable state management. I also handled multi-language support, third-party SDKs, and end-to-end app releases, ensuring reliable user experiences.

Beyond Flutter, Iâ€™m continuously expanding my skills into backend and full-stack development with Node.js, Express, and databases. My goal is to deliver complete, end-to-end solutions â€” from clean code and smooth UIs to scalable backends that power impactful applications.
